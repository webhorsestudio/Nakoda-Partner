# 🚀 Services Management System Migration

## 📋 Overview
This migration adds a comprehensive services management system to support the Services Details page, replacing the current mock data with real database-driven functionality.

## 🎯 What This Migration Accomplishes

### **1. Database Schema**
- **`services`** - Individual services with pricing, ratings, and metrics
- **`partner_services`** - Junction table linking partners to services
- **`service_orders`** - Service order tracking (for future use)

### **2. API Endpoints**
- **`/api/services`** - CRUD operations for services
- **`/api/services/stats`** - Dashboard statistics

### **3. TypeScript Types**
- Complete type definitions for all service-related data
- API response types and form data interfaces
- Filter and pagination types

### **4. Custom Hook**
- **`useServices`** - Comprehensive hook for services management
- Fetching, filtering, CRUD operations, and statistics

## 🗄️ Database Migration Steps

### **Step 1: Run the Migration**
1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `migration-services-simple.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute

### **Step 2: Verify Migration**
After running, you should see:
```sql
-- New tables created
services
partner_services

-- Sample data inserted
9 sample services

-- Indexes and permissions set up
```

### **Step 3: Check Sample Data**
```sql
-- Verify services
SELECT * FROM services ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## 🔧 Code Changes Made

### **1. New Files Created**
```
src/types/services.ts                    # Service type definitions
src/app/api/services/route.ts           # Main services API
src/app/api/services/stats/route.ts     # Statistics API
src/hooks/useServices.ts                # Services management hook
migration-create-services-system.sql     # Full migration
migration-services-simple.sql            # Simple migration for Supabase
```

### **2. Database Schema**
```sql
-- Services
services (
  id, name, description, base_price, 
  commission_percentage, is_active, total_providers, 
  total_orders, average_rating, created_at, updated_at
)

-- Partner Services (Junction)
partner_services (
  id, partner_id, service_id, custom_price, 
  custom_commission, is_available, total_orders, 
  total_revenue, rating, created_at, updated_at
)
```

## 📱 Next Steps: Update Services Details Page

### **Phase 1: Replace Mock Data (Current Task)**
1. **Update Services Details page** to use `useServices` hook
2. **Replace mock data** with real API calls
3. **Test basic functionality** (list, search, filter)

### **Phase 2: Add CRUD Operations**
1. **Create Service Form** - Add new services
2. **Edit Service Form** - Modify existing services
3. **Delete Confirmation** - Remove services
4. **Status Toggle** - Activate/deactivate services

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Features**
1. **Partner Service Assignment** - Link partners to services
2. **Advanced Filtering** - Price range, rating filters
3. **Bulk Operations** - CSV import/export

## 🧪 Testing the Migration

### **1. Test API Endpoints**
```bash
# Test services list
curl http://localhost:3000/api/services

# Test statistics
curl http://localhost:3000/api/services/stats
```

### **2. Test Database Queries**
```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name LIKE 'service%';

-- Check sample data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM services;
```

### **3. Test TypeScript Compilation**
```bash
npm run build
# Should compile without errors
```

## 🔍 Current Status

### **✅ Completed**
- [x] Database migration files created
- [x] TypeScript interfaces defined
- [x] API endpoints implemented
- [x] Custom hook created
- [x] Sample data prepared

### **🔄 In Progress**
- [ ] Update Services Details page to use real data
- [ ] Replace mock data with API calls
- [ ] Test basic functionality

### **⏳ Pending**
- [ ] Create/Edit service forms
- [ ] Delete confirmation modals
- [ ] Partner service assignment
- [ ] Advanced filtering and search

## 🚨 Important Notes

### **1. Database Dependencies**
- **Requires existing `partners` table** - Migration references `partners(id)`
- **Uses Supabase RLS** - Row Level Security enabled
- **Requires service role key** - API endpoints use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

### **2. Environment Variables**
Ensure these are set in your `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### **3. Permissions**
- **API endpoints** require service role key for full access
- **Frontend** will use authenticated user permissions
- **RLS policies** allow all operations for now (can be restricted later)

## 🎯 Immediate Next Action

**Update the Services Details page** (`src/app/admin/partners/services/page.tsx`) to:

1. **Import and use `useServices` hook**
2. **Replace mock data** with real services from the hook
3. **Update search and filter** to use real data
4. **Test basic functionality** with real data

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check Supabase logs** for database errors
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Check browser console** for API errors
4. **Ensure migration completed** successfully

## 🎉 Expected Results

After completing this migration and updating the Services Details page:

- ✅ **Real-time data** from database
- ✅ **Dynamic search and filtering**
- ✅ **Accurate statistics** and metrics
- ✅ **Professional service management** interface
- ✅ **Scalable architecture** for future features
