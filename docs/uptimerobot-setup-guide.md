3. You should see successful responses like:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Global sync completed successfully",

    "skipped": 0,
    "errors": 0,
    "lastSync": "2025-01-17T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Test 3: Manual Test
```bash
# Test your API directly
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/orders/global-sync

# Should return success response
```

## üìä What UptimeRobot Does

‚úÖ **Calls your API every 5 minutes**  
‚úÖ **Sends POST requests to `/api/orders/global-sync`**  
‚úÖ **Monitors response times and success rates**  
‚úÖ **Sends alerts if sync fails**  
‚úÖ **Provides detailed logs and statistics**  
‚úÖ **Works 24/7 without any user interaction**  

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Monitor Shows "Down"
**Possible Causes:**
- API endpoint is not accessible
- Server is down
- Network issues

**Solutions:**
1. Check if your website is accessible
2. Test the API endpoint manually
3. Check server logs
4. Verify the URL is correct

### Issue 2: Monitor Shows "Up" but No Sync Happening
**Possible Causes:**
- API returns success but doesn't actually sync
- Bitrix24 API issues
- Database connection problems

**Solutions:**
1. Check your application logs
2. Test the sync manually
3. Verify Bitrix24 API credentials
4. Check database connectivity

### Issue 3: Getting Too Many Alerts
**Solutions:**
1. Go to monitor settings
2. Increase "Alert Threshold" to 2-3 failures
3. Disable "Up Alerts" to only get failure notifications

## üìà Monitoring Best Practices

### 1. Check Dashboard Regularly
- Visit your UptimeRobot dashboard daily
- Look for any "Down" statuses
- Check response times for performance issues

### 2. Set Up Email Alerts
- Configure email notifications for failures
- Use a reliable email address
- Don't ignore alert emails

### 3. Monitor Response Times
- Normal response time: 5-15 seconds
- If consistently over 30 seconds, investigate
- Check for performance issues

### 4. Review Logs Periodically
- Check UptimeRobot response logs
- Look for error patterns
- Verify sync is working correctly
